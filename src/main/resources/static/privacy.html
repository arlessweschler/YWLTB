        I, the developer of this app, built the "YouTube Watch Later Telegram
        Bot" app as an Open Source Software app. This app is provided at no cost
        and is intended for use as is. The source of the app can be found on
        <a class="color-youtube" href="https://gitlab.com/madhead/YWLTB"
          >GitLab</a
        >
        and/or
        <a class="color-youtube" href="https://github.com/madhead/YWLTB"
          >GitHub</a
        >. This policy applies only to the original "YouTube Watch Later
        Telegram Bot" app hosted on this domain (<a

          href="https://ywltb.herokuapp.com"
          >https://ywltb.herokuapp.com</a

        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
        collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone
        decided to use my app.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of
        information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I
        collect is used for providing and improving the app. I will not use or

      <h2>
        <span class="line">Information Collection and Use</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The app does not collect or store any personal information, including
        names, emails or addresses. The information the app collects and stores
        is your Telegram user ID and YouTube API access and refresh tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Telegram user ID is used to associate you Telegram account and messages
        you send to the app via Telegram with your YouTube account.
      </p>
      <p>
        YouTube API tokens are used to add videos to your "Watch later"
        playlist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Telegram user ID and YouTube API tokens are stored after you
        configure the app by linking your Telegram account with your YouTube
        account by providing this app access to manage your YouTube content.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can revoke the access to your YouTube content at any time by
        removing the app from the list of the apps with access to your account
        in your
        <a class="color-youtube" href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions"
